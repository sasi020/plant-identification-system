# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Identification using MobileNetV2

## Overview  
This project identifies **40 types of medicinal plants** from images using the **MobileNetV2** deep learning architecture.  
The model is trained on a **10 GB dataset** sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), achieving high accuracy in plant classification.  
It is deployed as a **Flask web application** for real-time predictions, allowing users to upload plant images and get instant results.

## Features  
- **Real-Time Plant Identification** â€“ Upload a plant image to instantly identify the species.  
- **Probability Scores** â€“ Displays prediction confidence for better decision-making.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Simple web UI built with HTML and CSS.  
- **Lightweight Model** â€“ MobileNetV2 ensures fast and efficient performance.  
- **Custom Dataset Support** â€“ Easily retrain with your own dataset.

## How the Project Was Built  

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   - Dataset: **40 plant species**, 10 GB size.  
   - Sourced from Kaggle.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Images resized to 224x224 pixels.  
   - Normalization applied for faster convergence.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - MobileNetV2 used with transfer learning.  
   - Softmax output layer for multi-class classification.  
   - Achieved high accuracy after fine-tuning.  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Flask backend for prediction API.  
   - Simple HTML/CSS frontend for image uploads.
